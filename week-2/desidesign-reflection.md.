1.  What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

Information Gathering - In this phase you want to think about things like what the purpose of your site is going to be, who the target audience is, what is the goal of this site is, and what the content is going to be.

Planning- This phase involves creating a site map, that lays out the main ideas of the website, to help guide you into the design process.

Design - This phase is where you create a wireframe and begin making the individual personality of your site come to life with colors, fonts and layouts.

Development - In this phase the actual site is built using HTML and CSS to impliment the design and functionality discussed in previous phases.

Testing and Delivery - In this phase funtionality, compatibility and viewability are all tested to make sure that your site can be viewed by people using differnt devices and software.  This is also a point when you should be testing and making sure that code validates and is up current development standards.  After all of the testing and validation is done the site is ready to be launched to the public.

Maintenance - This is done by adding new content or products to keep users coming back.  As well as adding improvements to elevate the user experience.

2.  What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The primary purpose of my site is to share information about me.  The primary goal is introduce myself and my technical skills to my peers and potential employers.

My site will feature content such as a technical blog, coding projects, my resume and information about me (including contact information links to social media and a introduction paragraph).

3.  What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

The target audience of my site is going to be peers and and potential employers in the technology industry.  They are interested in networking and interacting with creative people with a technical background.  They are looking hire and foster growth in young developers.

My site is going to address these target groups with a sleek easy to use layout and design that contains interesting in depth technical content and resources.  As well as links to my personal information.

4.  What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

I would like potential employers coming to my site to ultimately contact me to discuss my work.  Before doing that they would have to read my blog, look through my project portfolio and view my resume.  For them to stick around that long the site needs to be very concise and easy to navigate.

For peers visiting my site I would like them to read my blog and look through my portfolio then share content they like on social media.

5.  What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

I think the main take away from the readings on user experience is that every design element of a website effects a users experience.  Design will also not always make everyone happy no matter how much emphasis is placed on user experience.  What works for one person or website is not going to work for every person or site.  User experience is how a user feels when using a system and is not the same as usability which is how user friendly a site is.

6.  What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

User experience design is the implementation of design elements that enhance a users experience when interacting with a website.  This includes functionality, layout, readability and accessibility among other factors.  This is important because user experience design can dictate how a user perceives a website.  If it is done well, it will solve a problem and leaves users feeling satisfied while visiting your site, thus, bringing them back later.

7.  Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I think the part of this challenge that I found most tedious was trying to map out my ideas.  It is probably the simpliest thing to do and yet I think it is also the most abstract thing to do.  I felt like I wanted to keep going deeper into the design and layout process.
