1. What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is a more detailed version of a site map.  A wireframe is a design tool that allows you to plan the content layout of a web page.  It is the framework/blueprint you will use to guide you through the design process.  A wireframe does not contain design specifics such as content, images, color or font choices.

2. What are the benefits of wire framing?

Wire framing is beneficial because it allows you to take your thoughts down on paper and make changes before trying to add design elements and code.  It also helps you establish the priority of the websites content.  Where is the best place for the most important and least important information.  Wire framing is also beneficial because it allows you to plan how the site is going to function and how your users will interact with the site.  All of this planning makes the coding process much easier because you are able to see what you need and where it should go.

3. Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

I honestly enjoyed it more than I thought I would.  I tend to like to jump into a project and feel it out as I go along.  So when I first saw this challenge I kind of thought it would be a waste of time, I quickly learned the value of wire framing.  I had a lot of ideas and wire framing my site allowed me to really see what ideas were going to work and which once needed to be rethought.  I used and online software and really enjoyed getting to easily move things around and add different elements to the website.  Wire framing is something I would have never though to do and now I know that it is something I will used for every project moving forward.

4. Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I ended up revising my wireframe.  I wanted a really simple layout and that was pretty much all I knew going in.  As I started to put content in my wireframe I had to revise where I wanted things to be in order to make the content more balanced.  Finding a balance was difficult because different content items take up different amounts of space.  I guess I know that conceptually going in, but until I saw what it looked like I did not realize how the layout would be affected by size of the individual content blocks.

5. What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I asked myself what a good website/blog looks like and feels like, to me.  So I spent a lot of time looking at other peoples blogs and personal websites. I tried to analyze the structural elements and functionality that I liked.  It helped me to figure out where the best place to put a button might be, where my photo should go so that it is not the center of attention.   I also spent time looking at websites to see if I could understand what the purpose of that site was and at what point that purpose became clear to me.  Sometimes it was right away looking at the header, but sometimes I also had to read deep into the content to understand what the goal of the site was.  Looking at these other websites and blogs helped me understand how someone reads a website and how their eye is drawn through the site.

6. Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I really enjoyed the research that I did mentioned above.  I think that it helped me get an idea of what I wanted my site to look like.  It would have been easy to just read the challenge materials about what a wireframe is and create a basic one, but I really wanted to use my wireframe as a detailed map for my site.  I thought it was tedious to find a wire framing tool that was user friendly for me.  I tried using a couple and very quickly got frustrated with the functionality.  I eventually tried Cacoo and at first was frustrated with it too, but I was able to figure it out and once I did I really enjoyed using it and think that I was able to create a really clear image of what my site was going to look like.
