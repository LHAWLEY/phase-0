What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a number that does not have a decimal point (6, 20, 257).  A float is a number that does contain a decimal point (2.5, -1.8, 0.9).

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

When dividing numbers containg a float you can return floats (9.0/2.0 returns 4.5).  When dividing number using integers you can only return integers (9/2 returns 4).

``` ruby puts (24 * 365) '''

``` ruby puts ((60 * 24) * 365) * 10
'''

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

This challenge was great.  It was a really helpful review.  I have not touched Ruby since I finished my admissions interview with DBC, months ago.  I am really glad this material was presented
