1. What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?

It is important to know that all of the pages on a website can share the same stylesheet so that you do not need to type the same code over and over again.  If you want to make changes to a file you only need to make them in one of the CSS files.

2. What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?

It was a little hard to get everything positioned as we would have wanted it.  We still have some formatting that we should go back and adjust, but there was just not enough time this week.  I think that we needed to adjust our HTML to make the external links into a table so they laid out properly.  I think that would have fixed one of our major issues.  I thought that it was kind of hard to bounce back and for the between the html file and the css file and know/remember what css was linked here.

3. What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)

Color (to change the font colors), font-weight (to change text to bold), :linked (to change the default color of the links), :visited (to show when a user clicked on a link), align (to get the elements to move on the page where we wanted them to).

4. Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?

Yes, we used quite a few classes because there were a lot of items in our HTML that we wanted to be formatted in the same way.  I don’t think we used and id’s, but we probably could have to make the code a little more streamline.  A class can be used to apply the same styling to multiple items, where and id should only be used to apply styling on one specific item.

5. When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?

I think that our site was probably a little messier.  We were so excited to dive in and try formatting everything that we never really had time to go back and clean up the file.  We timeboxed this project and I would have liked to have gone back and implemented some other formatting and cleaned up the code a little bit, but time did not permit this week.  It is something that I might try to go back and work on this week if there is time with all of the new challenges.  I know that it could be better.
