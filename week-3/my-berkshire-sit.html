1. What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

I have worked with HTML a little bit in the past, before I applied to DBC, so this was kind of a refresher for me.  I did gets stuck on some of the links and had to really think about where I placed things.  I enjoyed taking the HTML commands we learned and actually creating something with them.  This is a very basic website outline, but I still think it is kind of cool to see what is created with what seems like a bunch of gibberish.

2. How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

I thought that it was interesting and a little different using HTML5.  I was well versed in the version of HTML that was used in the codecademy class which I believe is HTML4.  So trying to commit the new commands to memory and figure out when and how to use HTML5 was a bit challenging. However, I did find that that the HTML & CSS book by Jon Duckett proved very helpful in researching and using HTML5.

3. How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

For this assignment I found it pretty easy, because the it was such a basic outline of a website.  I think if we were given a more detailed image of the website to recreate it would have been more difficult for me to not want to format the site fully.

4. What seems good and bad about HTML?

I think that HTML is good because it allows you to build a skeleton of your site and see what the basic formatting looks like, it also allows you to pretty easily modify the layout.  HTML is not so good because it is limited in its capabilities as far as design which is why it is used with CSS

5. What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I think that it is going to be a whole lot of practice.  I might try to implement flash cards over the next couple of weeks just to associate the different functions with the syntax.  Eventually it will become engrained in my mind, but until that happens it is just going to take a lot of practice using different commands and referencing the book mentioned above.
