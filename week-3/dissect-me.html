  <h4>What are the benefits of version control?</h4>
  <p>I think version control is benefitial for three main reasons. It allows multiple individuals to work on a file at the same time and later update that file by merging all of the changes to one master version of the file. Version control serves as a hisorical record of the file because it stores a version of the file everytime a change is made. It is because of this that we are able to restore previous versions of a file if needed. This is good because you can never really mess up a file and even if you do you can always go back to a previous version, restore it and continue working. Finally, version control is benefitial because when you save a change to a file you have to include a description of what the change was. This allows people working on the file days, weeks and even years from now a chance to understand the rational behind an integration.</p>

  <h4>How does git help you keep track of changes? </h4>
  <p>Git helps keep track of changes because it is a version control system. Therefore it has all of the benefits mentioned above. Git allows users (one or many) to work seamlessly on a file at the same time. Git is really helpful in keeping track of changes because it is a complete record of all of the changes made to a file. You can look back at a file from its inception and see what was changed, who made the change and get an idea of why that change was made.</p>

  <h4>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h4>
  <p>I have explained the benefits of git as a version control system above. If you are using git as your version control system you should use GitHub to store code because they work together. GitHub is a remote location that allows you to upload and store everything in one place online. GitHub also forsters collaboration because it allows your files to be accessed by many users. You can post your project on GitHub and by making it public other people can create and submit changes to be incorporated into the master document.</p>

1.  What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

I used the <main>, <section>, <p> and <h#> tags.  I think these tags are pretty basic and really useful for dividing up something simple like a blog.  They allow for me to control large blocks of content and apply design elements really easily.

2.  How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

The html elements get laid out on the page in groups.  The browser reads and interprets the html top to bottom by section (similar to how we read a book top to bottom left to right).  So it is important when planning your site that you make sure your elements are laid out the way you want the browser to interpret them the most important first and the least important last.

3.  What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learned that you can create templates or "snippets" in sublime.  I did not know this was possible, but I think this will be really helpful moving forward because a lot of my pages for my website are going to be pretty similar as far as layout.  I think it will be nice to just open my html snippet and add the new content for a new blog post on my website.

I think that once I get the basic CSS added to my blog I will create a snippet for my CSS formating of my website, again because much of the layout and design will be similar throughout my website.  I think that if snippets are created and used properly they can really make coding fast and efficient.
