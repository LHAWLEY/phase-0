1. How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

Chrome's DevTools inspector allows you to test formating and positioning in the browser before commiting changes to your file.

2. How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

There are many ways to resize elements on the DOM using CSS.  You can change the width the height by using the CSS resize property with values set at any of the following: none (default value), both (changes the height and width of and element), horizontal (changes the width of an element), vertical (changes the height of and element), initial (sets the element to the its default value) and inherit (gets its size property from its parent element).


3. What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

Absolute positioning is when an element is taken out of the static flow.  The element that has absolute positioning no longer has an affect on the rest of the elements on a webpage and remains where it is placed even if the other elements move when the user scrolls thought the page.

Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that positions an element in relation to the browser window so that it stays in the same place on the page even if a user scrolls down the page.

Static positioning is the default of an element.  It is when each of the elements simply sits on top of one another down the page.

Relative positioning moves an element in a specified direction (top, bottom, left, right)of what would be the default static positioning of a document.

I think that static postioning is the easiest to understand because it is the default.  I think that fixed was the hardest to understand because it requires you to think about the relationship of an element to the whole browser and not just to the other elements on the page.

4. What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

Margins are outside of the boarder and allow you to control the space between the boarders of boxes that are next to one another.

Boarders separate the edge of one box from another.

Padding is the space between the boarder of a box and any content that is in a box.  By adding padding you can increase readability.

So padding goes around content, inside of a boarder, inside of margins.

5. What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

I really liked this challenge.  I thought that it exposed us to a new resource that could come in pretty handy in the future.  When I first saw the challenge I thought it was going to be way too easy, parts were, but I think the parts that were challenging really pushed us to use our CSS skills and do some research to figure out the solution.
