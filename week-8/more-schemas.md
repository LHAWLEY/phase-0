1.  What is a one-to-one database?

    A one-to-one dateabase is a database in which two things have a single relationship.

2.  When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in    terms of the example you created).

    You would want to use a one-to-one database when two tables have a single relationship to each other.  All of the information in a one-to-one relationship could have been stored together in one table, but it may be necessary to separate out information sometimes into a separate table that is updated separately or if the values of the second table would create a lot of NULL values in the original table.

3.  What is a many-to-many database?

    A many-to-many database is when to databases are are connected using a join table that tracks the original two tables with foreign keys.

4.  When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).

    You would want to use a many-to-many database when you have two tables that relate to each other in many ways.  An example is teachers and courses.  Teachers can teach multiple courses and courses can be tought by multiple teachers.

5.  What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?

    I think that everything makes sense right now.  I understand what the different databases look like.  I think that once we actually get into using data that impliments multiple relationships at once this well get more confusing.  Just looking at the example in Release 5 is scary right now.
