#H1 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
1. Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?
I learned about time boxing, how to create new "tiny" habits and how it can be helpful to break a large project into smaller pieces to help make it a less daunting or overwhelming.

2. What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?
Time Boxing is taking a set block of time to work on a project.  Setting a timer for 30 minutes, working on a problem and then stoping to take a break and reflect on what you have done and what still needs to be accomplished.

I think this will be helpful to me in Phase 0, because by implementing Time Boxing I feel like I will eliminate my chances of burning out or getting frustrated on a specific challenge.  I also think this technique will be helpful because it has a built in time for reflection.  You have to stop, see what you have done, see what still needs to be done and reassess how you want to attack the problem moving forward.  I think this will benefit me because I tend to get tunnel vision and just want to finish something.  This technique if used appropriately should help eliminate that tendency.

3. How do you manage your time currently?
I am a morning person who lives for her routine.  I have pretty much the same daily schedule which allows me to consistently accomplish my goals.  Currently I make lists of things that I need to do.  I have multiple some are for one specific day and some are running lists of bigger or less important items that are not time sensitive.  I try to have my daily list together before I go to bed every night so that when I wake up in the morning I know exactly what my priorities are.

4. Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
I think my current strategy works pretty well because it is so structured.  I would say that the only part of my routine that does not really work for me is that because I do so much I tend to go at 100% all day, sometimes I crash and burn (which really is not as dramatic as it sounds).  It is something I am aware of and I have been trying to create some relaxing "me" time into my schedule as well.

5. Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
I want to implement some sort of a time boxing technique in to my routine.  I think that it will help increase my focus and productivity.  I tend to try to do many things at once and sometimes that is just not efficient.   By implementing a time boxing technique I think that I will be able to focus on and complete a task in an efficient manner and move on to the next with a clear focused mind.  I am going to start by doing this with some of the "long" challenges and hopefully time boxing can just become a normal part of my DBC and life routine.  In order to limit my stress level and narrow my focus I am going to start doing yoga again.  I think that this will help me clear my mind a little bit which I think will increase my productivity.

6. What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
I have a busy schedule and although I know I will have to cut back on a lot of my personal fluff during my time in Phase 0 it is easier said than done.  I want to ensure that my time working on DBC is as focused and productive as possible.   So I have already decided that I am going to start doing my DBC work outside of my normal habitat.  My apartment building has conference/study rooms so I am going to go up there and work free from distractions (away from my tv, dog and my phone).  I am going to make Monday, Friday and Saturday my main days where I do not book anything so that I can dedicate them wholly to DBC work.  I am going to implement time boxing to my DBC working times, I think that it will allow for a lot of reflection on my progress and allow me to revisit a challenge with a new way of thinking about the problem.

#H2 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
1. What is a shell? What is "bash?"
A shell a command interpreter.  Bash is a users default shell which lets users change the default settings to their preferences.

2. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
The most challenging part was time management.  It was hard to figure out how much time to spend on this section knowing that I still have lots of work to do for the week.  There is so much material in this section and to sit down and try to understand the ins and outs of the "crash course" could have taken me much more time than I had this week.  It is something I will need to go back and practice more.  I think that I have a grasp on the overall concepts. It is going to take practicing the different commands in actual scenarios to fully understand the uses.
3. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
I went through all of the sections of the “Crash Course”.  For some reason I got stuck when the text editor came into play which began at “view a file” I think. I kept getting an error that the file I just created did not exist, although I know it did.  I stepped away and moved on then went back and eventually figured out what I did wrong.

4. In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
I think that it will be most important to know the commands that allow us to move and find items efficiently in a specific and different directories so "grep" "cd" "ls".  I think after that “man” is important just because it is a valuable reference tool.  Finally, I think that when working in groups in a work environment it is going to be important control who can do what as far as modifying a particular directory so "chmod" and "chown" will be valuable in protecting the directories.

5. Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
-pwd (print working directory)

-ls (list directory)

-mv (move directory)

-cd (change directories)

-../ (lets you move in a directory)

-touch (create new blank file)

-mkdir (make a directory)

-less (page through a file)

-rmdir (remove a directory)

-rm (remove a file)

-help (allows you to look up commands)

#H3 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

1. If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?
To create a new repo you need to log into your github account. Then in the top right corner you click the “+” sign, click on the drop down and select “new repository”. When the “create a new repository” screen pops up enter a short descriptive Repository name.  Then you can select your settings decide if you would like to make the repository public or private. Then selection under "Initialize this repository with a README" then click “Create repository".
To fork a repo you log into github pick the repository that you would like to fork.  In the top right hand corner click the “fork” icon and select the account you would like to assign it to.
To clone a repo select URL of the repo you would like to clone from github and on the lower right hand side you will see a URL under HTTPS.  In your terminal type "git clone (paste your URL)".
You would fork a repository instead of creating a new one because you want to work on a file that someone else has created, but on your own without affecting the master document.  If you created a new repo it would just be a blank repository with no content to work off of.

2. What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
I did not think setting up git and GitHub was too difficult.  I thought that navigating in git was what created difficulty for me specifically deleting the local copy using the command line.  I found GitHub to be really easy to navigate and I think that the videos and reading materials did a really great job explaining the basic commands and processes necessary to work in GitHub.  I think I learned that I need to practice my commands and really take my time when working in git.
