#H4 1.6 Your Website, part 1

1. Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.
https://github.com/LHAWLEY/LHAWLEY.github.io.git

2. Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
To create a new repository you need to log into your GitHub account. Then in the top right corner you click the “+” sign, click on the drop down and select “new repository”. When the “create a new repository” screen pops up enter a short descriptive repository name.  Then you can select your settings decide if you would like to make the repository public or private. Then select a License option under by checking the box next to "Initialize this repository with a README" then selecting an option under the "Add a license" drop down menu.  Once you are done with that click “Create repository".

To clone a repository select URL of the repository you would like to clone from github and on the lower right hand side you will see a URL under HTTPS.  In your terminal type "git clone (paste your URL)".

3. Describe what open source means.
Open Sources is a way to allow anyone to see how a computer program was created and then customize that program to their preferences.  Open source gives users access the source code of a program.

4. What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think open source is a great tool for any developer. As a new developer I think it will be interesting to be able to look at how different software is created to better understand structure and best practices. I like that it allows for collaboration and input into a project. It allows for bugs to be fixed that might have been missed if you were keeping a project all to yourself. I also think it is a little nerve wraking because you are putting your work out there for anyone to touch, amend and use as they choose. I think my main issue with open source would be the feeling of relinquishing control of a project I was working on.

5. Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses are an important aspect in controlling your work.  Licenses allow you to grant others access to use your work while still being credited as the originator, thereby preventing others from claiming your work as their own.

6. What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

Going through the process of tracking changes, making changes, pushing changes and pulling changes again in this challenge was very helpful.  It took me a bit of time to get it the first time, but this second time I was able to move through it slightly faster and easier. I don't really think the full process is solidified to a point where I would not need to reference notes or materials provided to us.  I do think that the flow of the overall process was solidified by this last challenge.
Everytime I get something to work properly is an "aha" moment for me.  I think this is because I am still not confident with every command I enter.  So when I do something right I feel like I have a moment of validation and clarity regarding the effects of a command.
I struggle with memorizing the commands to go through the whole process.  I find myself referencing different sections and parts of videos to remember the commands that need to be entered to complete a process.  I think it will take time to commit them to memory and that will come with practice.

7. Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I wish I had read this question before I started working on the section, because I honesly do not remember the different resouces I used.  By the time I got here I had closed all of my window.  I will say that I have been googling often in all of the sections this week.  Not necessarily for a lack of understanding, but to broaden my overall picture of a topic or concept. In this section, because I did not really feel knowledgable to speak about my opinion on open source, I did a search on the good and the bad associated with the open sources software to get an idea of both sides of the spectrum and read a few differnt articles on the topic.
