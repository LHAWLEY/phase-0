// Pseudocode

// Create a variable that takes an array of number elements (it can be contain any number of elements).
// Create three separate operations that can all be run on your list of numbers.

// Operation 1 should take all of the elements in your numbers variable and add them up to get the sum.

// Operation 2 should find the average (mean) of the numbers variable.  To do so:
  // First calculate the sum of all of the numbers.
  // Then divide the sum by the number of elements in the variable.


// Operation 3 (has two senarios depending on the number of elements in the numbers variable) you should find the middle (median) value of the elements in the numbers variable.  To do so:
  // If there is an odd number of elements in the numbers variable:
  //First order the numbers either from lowest to highest or highest to lowest.
  // Then find the middle value of the numbers variable which is the median.

  // If there is an even number of elements in the numbers variable:
  // First order the numbers either from lowest to highest or highest to lowest.
  // Find find the two middle values.
  // Add the two middle values together then divide them by two.
  // That should give you the median
