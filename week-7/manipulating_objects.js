// Manipulating JavaScript Objects

// I worked on this challenge: [by myself]

// There is a section below where you will write your code.

// DO NOT ALTER THIS OBJECT BY ADDING ANYTHING WITHIN THE CURLY BRACES!
var terah = {
  name: "Terah",
  age: 32,
  height: 66,
  weight: 130,
  hairColor: "brown",
  eyeColor: "brown"
}
// __________________________________________
// Write your code below.

var adam = {
  name: "Adam"
}

terah.spouse = adam;
terah.weight = 125;
delete terah.eyeColor;
adam.spouse = terah;
terah.children = {};
terah.children.carson = {name: "Carson"};
terah.children.carter = {name: "Carter"};
terah.children.colton = {name: "Colton"};
adam.children = terah.children;

// What tests did you have trouble passing? What did you do to make it pass? Why did that work?

//  I had trouble creating the first child carson.  Once I did one the others were pretty much the same so there was no issue there.   When I got stuck I looked a the driver code for hints at how to debug my code and I also referenced my book to make sure I was remembering how on object was structured.  I also found that reading the instructions in Release 2 more carefully proved really helpful.  I also had issues sharing properties between Terah and Adam.  Once I stopped and thought about how to make them share properties it was pretty easy to move on.

// How difficult was it to add and delete properties outside of the object itself?

//  I thought deleting and adding properties was pretty easy from outside of an object.  I did not really struggle with these two concepts.

// What did you learn about manipulating objects in this challenge?

//  I learned that it is easy to manipulate objects outside of the object using the dot method.  I think that is was so simple because it is very similar to Ruby.
